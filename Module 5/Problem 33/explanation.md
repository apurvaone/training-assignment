### Explanation: 

The transformation involves following operations:


* `modify-overwrite-beta` : it creates new fields "id", "hobby_name", "hobby_level", and "name" using values from different locations in the input object. Specifically, it assigns the value of the "id" field from the third level (index 3) to the "id" field in the output object, the value of the "name" field from the first level to the "hobby_name" field, the value of the "level" field from the first level  to the "hobby_level" field, and the value of the "name" field from the third level to the "name" field.

* `shift:` It selects the hobbies list as it is and rejects other fields.

* `remove` It removes the "level" field from all objects in the output object.
